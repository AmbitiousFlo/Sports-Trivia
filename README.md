# Sports Trivia

## User Story 

As A user 
I WANT to take a quiz on random sports facts
So I can see how well I do after each question
AND I can see my final score at the end of the quiz


## Description 

Welcome to Sports Trivia! This project was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and was designed to test you on your sports trivia skills. In order to accomplish this project we used the <a href="https://opentdb.com/">Open Trivia Database API</a> as well as the<a href="https://imgflip.com/api"> Image Flip API.</a>

Leveraging Javascript with the two APIs we were able to associate a particular image depending on if you answered the question correctly or not. Each question has been pulled dynamically from the Open Trivia API in Java Script so it can randomize the questions for you. After answering the question you will be met with a "Correct"(Green) or Incorrect"(Red), depending on your answer you will also receive an image based on what you choose. Finally when you have finished you will receive your final results in red.

# Motivation

Our motivation for this project was to primarily learn how to work within a team enviornment to accomplish tasks in order to create a project that we all could be proud of, the love of sports helped guide our group on our topic for the project. After having a concise topic to work on the motivation for the project became easier and the more we worked on the Sports Trivia Quiz, seeing all of our thoughts come together so nicely made it all worth it.
